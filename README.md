## Configuration
To configure Mail Sender API, you will need to modify an existing config file default.json located in the config directory.
Mail provider credentials and auth details are encrypted using Crypto library for security reasons.

Use /scripts/encrypt.js to encrypt the keys.

## Build and deployment
This API can be built as a docker image and run as docker container in local.

* Prerequisites: Linux machine with Docker toolbox<br />
* Build: Run the below command in the root folder of repository<br />
    ```bash
    docker build -t mail-sender . --no-cache
  # The above command needs internet connection, make sure proxy is not enabled. If enabled pass arguments --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=<YourProxy> and --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=<YourProxy> in the command.
    ```
* Run: To bring up the service execute the below command<br />
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 mail-sender
  # Runs the container and exposes port 3000. To validate service run curl on health end point
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/_health
  # `Mail service is healthy!`
    ```

Further, To deploy this service to a server, Push the mail-sender docker image to docker registry and run as a container on any cloud platform.

## Future Enhancements & Notes
* Add environment specific configuration file support.
* Add integration test scripts between Api and Providers.
* Implement Build and Deployment specs for CI and CD.
* Tighten the input validations, especially Email address format.
* Fetch the encryption key from datastore before decrypting provider credentials/auth.
* Create Swagger specs or API docs for mail sender API
* Address TODOs in src files
