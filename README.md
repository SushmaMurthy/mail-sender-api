## Configuration
To configure Mail Sender API, you will need to modify an existing config file default.json located in the config directory.
Mail provider credentials and auth details are encrypted using Crypto library for security reasons.

Use /scripts/encrypt.js to encrypt the keys.

## Future Enhancements & Notes
* Add environment specific configuration file support.
* Add integration test scripts between Api and Providers.
* Implement Build and Deployment specs for CI and CD.
* Tighten the input validations, especially Email address format.
* Fetch the encryption key from datastore before decrypting provider credentials/auth.
* Create Swagger specs or API docs for mail sender API
* Address TODOs in src files
